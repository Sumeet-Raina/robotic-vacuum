# Robotic-vacuum

Robotic-vacumm is a Javascript library that allows a user to provide input instructions for a robotic cleaner which include room size, cleaner start-point, locations of dirt patches and movement instructions. The library uses this and returns information on how many dirt patches have been cleaned up as well as the final location of the hoover.

## Specification

### Requirements

Output should return:
* The final hoover position (X,Y).
* The number of patches of dirt the robot cleaned up.

### Acceptance Criteria

Example input (input.txt):
```
5 5
1 2
1 0
2 2

```
